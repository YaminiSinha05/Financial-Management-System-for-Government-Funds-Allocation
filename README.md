# Financial-Management-System-for-Government-Funds-Allocation
This Java program models a financial management system that simulates the allocation and tracking of funds within a governmental structure. The system consists of multiple hierarchical entities such as the Government, Departments, Schemes, and Non-Tax Revenue sources, with financial transactions occurring between them.

Government: Manages and oversees departments, each with a predefined budget.
Department: Holds multiple schemes and allocates funds accordingly.
Scheme: Represents specific programs under a department that receive financial resources.
Non-Tax Revenue: Represents alternative funding sources such as donations or fees.
Employee: Requests funds for different schemes.
Transaction: Handles fund transfers between different financial entities.
By integrating abstraction and encapsulation, this system provides a structured way to manage government spending, track fund distribution, and ensure transparency in budget allocation.
